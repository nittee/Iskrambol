# Game Design Document (GDD)

This is based on the **One-page Design Document**.  
This file will continue to evolve during the development process.

## Game Identity / Mantra

*A single sentence description of the game that you will use to guide design decisions.*

A wireless local PvP multiplayer word game designed to gauge the players' vocabulary knowledge while racing against other players or against time (single-player mode).

## Design Pillars

*Three words or phrases that convey the feeling or emotion you want the players to experience.*

Confusion (?). AHA-moment.

## Mechanics

*List what the game is from a gameplay perspective.*

- The host can input a parent word with at least 6 letters or choose at random.  
- Under a specified time limit, the players will jumble the letters of the parent word to distinguish an existing word from the dictionary (English or Tagalog).  
- Points will be given based on the complexity of the word distinguished.

## Features

*List the cool features or unique elements that you want to include in your game.*

- wireless local PvP
- multiplayer (or single-player)
- with built-in dictionary (?)

## Interface

*List the player input method, the controls, and how the player interacts with your game.*

- touch-based
- options are given

## Art Style

*Include references to lots of images and games that have a similar aesthetic to what you're trying to achive.*

- **TODO**

## Music / Sound

*Include links to music and sound design similar to what you're tring to achieve. You can also list the emotional responses that the sound should invoke in the players.*

- calming
- Chopin's Nocturnes, Op. 9 No. 2 in E-Flat Major Andante

## Target Platform and Audience

*Describes who the game is for. Bullets can often be clearer than paragraphs. Full sentences sometimes use too many words.*

- Platform: Android 9.0 Pie (for **83.8%** can download the game [[Android Distribution](https://9to5google.com/2023/06/02/android-13-june-distribution/)])
- Audience: Students with friends
- Storage: **TODO**
