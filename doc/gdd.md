## Game Identity / Matra

_A single sentence description of the game that you will use to guide design decisions._

A wireless local PvP multiplayer word game designed to gauge the players' vocabulary knowledge while racing against other players or against time (single-player mode).

## Design Pillars

_Three words or phrases that convey the feeling or emotion you want the players to experience._

Confusion (?). AHA-moment.

## Mechanics

_List what the game is from a gameplay perspective._

- The host can input a parent word with at least 6 letters or choose at random.  
- Under a specified time limit, the players will jumble the letters of the parent word to distinguish an existing word from the dictionary (English or Tagalog).  
- Points will be given based on the complexity of the word distinguished.

## Features

_List the cool features or unique elements that you want to include in your game._

- wireless local PvP
- multiplayer (or single-player)
- with built-in dictionary (?)

## Interface

_List the player input method, the controls, and how the player interacts with your game._

- touch-based
- options are given

## Art Style

_Include references to lots of images and games that have a similar aesthetic to what you're trying to achive._

TODO

## Music / Sound

_Include links to music and sound design similar to what you're tring to achieve. You can also list the emotional responses that the sound should invoke in the players._

- calming
- Chopin's Nocturnes, Op. 9 No. 2 in E-Flat Major Andante

## Target Platform and Audience

_Describes who the game is for. Bullets can often be clearer than paragraphs. Full sentences sometimes use too many words._

- Audience: Students with friends
